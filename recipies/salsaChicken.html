    <h3>Description & Ingredients:</h3>
    
    <p class="recipedescription">This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! Someone gave me this recipe a few years back, 
        and it has become a household favorite.
        Depending on your taste, you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa. 
        I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.
